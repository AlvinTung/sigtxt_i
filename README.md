# sigtxt_i
My interpretation of the sigtxt program originally conceived by Allison Parrish and documented here: https://medium.com/dbrs-innovation-labs/semantic-arithmetic-ddae153ca849

To use: "python3 sigtxt_i.py" 

Put source texts into files "s1" and "s2".

Results generated into file "results"

Be warned, results can take over 2 minutes to process for a 200 word text even with multiprocessing implemented
